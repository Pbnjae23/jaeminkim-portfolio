Please restructure the /case-studies/verizon hero section into a three-column layout with these specifications:
Hero Section Three-Column Layout

Column Distribution:

First column: 40% of available width
Second column: 30% of available width
Third column: 30% of available width
Set horizontal gaps of 60px between each column


First Column Content:

Headline: "How I Designed Verizon's B2B Ecosystem to Achieve an 18% CR Lift"
Maintain current large font size and left alignment
Optimize vertical positioning to align with the top of adjacent columns


Second Column Content:

Contains only the two new information containers stacked vertically:
Container 1:

Header: "Problem" (bold font weight)
Text: "While Verizon's cutting-edge 5G edge solutions enable significant production scaling and resource optimization for mid-to-large-sized businesses. However, there was a crucial gap. To bridge this gap, Verizon needed an ecosystem capable of monetizing these solutions and validating their broad framework."


Container 2:

Header: "Solution" (bold font weight)
Text: "In response, I collaborated closely with a diverse team from Verizon, including stakeholders, the CX team, researchers, and engineers. Our mission was to design a set of dynamic landing pages that would educate and inspire businesses, highlighting the game-changing benefits of 5G Edge solutions and showcasing how these innovations can keep them at the forefront of their industries."




Third Column Content:

Contains the three original information containers stacked vertically:
Container 1:

Header: "5G Edge Solutions Ecosystem"
Text: "https://verizon.com/business"


Container 2:

Header: "Year"
Text: "2023"


Container 3:

Header: "Intro"
Text: "Verizon's innovative 5G Edge solutions designed to help businesses scale in the competitive tech industry."




Consistent Container Styling:

Maintain 1px bottom borders on all containers
Keep 42px vertical spacing between all containers within each column
Preserve the bold headers and regular weight body text formatting
Ensure consistent text size hierarchy across all three columns


Responsive Behavior:

On tablet/mobile breakpoints, convert to a single column layout
Stack in this order: headline, problem/solution containers, then the remaining containers
Maintain appropriate vertical spacing when collapsed
